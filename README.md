### Current Status: Removing paperwork from doctors' lives

Once I finished [Executive Engineering](https://jackdanger.com/books/executive-engineering/) I joined [Datavant](https://www.datavant.com/) to eliminate paperwork the healthcare industry and use digitized medical records to accelerate medical research. Seems to be going well. If you're looking for a high-impact role reach out at jack.danger at the company domain.
